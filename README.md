This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error: passing an array of strings to a function expecting a single string. The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.ts` provides a corrected version that handles both single strings and arrays of strings.  The solution showcases how to handle different input types in a function, improving the robustness of the code.
